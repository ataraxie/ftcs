\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

In this section we evaluate~\APIName efficiency on detecting server failures and recovering from them (Section~\ref{sub:eval:server-recovery}).
Additionally, we evaluate the time it takes for a new client to fully join a~\APIName Web app, i.e. establish a web socket connection to the running server and receive the server state with its list of successors (Section~\ref{sub:eval:connection}); as well as package traffic through the devices connected with a~\APIName Web app (Section~\ref{sub:eval:traffic}).
