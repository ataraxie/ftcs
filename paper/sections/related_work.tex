\textbf{Zeroconf.}
Several researchers propose have investigated Zeroconf~\cite{Gunes2002, Bohnenkamp2003, Jara:2012:IPv6DNS-SD}.
For instance, \cite{hong2007accelerating} discusses that Zeroconf service discovery may cause overheads to the network while discovering new services.
Thus, proposing an algorithm to accelerate service discovery based on network topology changes.
Since a server failure would imply a change in the network topology, i.e. the server node being removed from the topology, 
client nodes our implementation could use their approach to accelerate service discovery. 
Nonetheless, their implementation used a LINUX Wireless extensions, which may not be accessible within a browser.
Thus, we used the FlyWeb service discovery implementation.

In~\cite{stolikj2016context}, Stolikj et al. argue that the number of published services in a network may also slow down service discovery.
As a solution, they propose a context based approach, where queries specify which services they are interested in.
This context based approach is highly suitable for our work and we could use it to filter \APIshort services.
However, their approach changes service discovery queries and we question whether this could be easily integrated with existing devices.
