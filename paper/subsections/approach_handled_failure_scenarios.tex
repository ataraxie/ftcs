\subsection{Handled Failure Scenarios}
\label{sub:approach_handled_failure_scenarios}

With our replication and consistency strategies, we handle different scenarios of failures gracefully. There are further scenarios that represent edge cases that we do not cope with at the moment. We address these in section~\ref{sec:limitations_and_future_work}.

\textbf{Client disconnection.} While disconnecting clients are mostly a trivial circumstance in traditional Web apps, they are more complex in \APIshort apps because the system relies on clients being represented in the shared \texttt{successors} list. A disconnecting client will trigger a \texttt{close} event on the current server for the associated WebSocket channel and the disconnected client's ID is obtained. The ID is then removed from the \texttt{successors} list on the shared state and the update is broadcasted. If the disconnected client was the first element in the \texttt{successors} list, the list will be shifted and the second element will be the new first successor.

\textbf{Server disconnection.} A disconnected server will result in a WebSocket \texttt{close} event triggered at each connected client. After some time, the service discovery mechanism described in section~\ref{sub:approach_conceptual_description} will reveal that there is no more service currently registered with the app's service name. This is the time when one of the previously connected client nodes will become the next server\footnote{We considered starting the next server immediately subsequent to a WebSocket close event but restrained from this approach. See section~\ref{sec:limitations_and_future_work} for our reasoning.}: each client compares the first item in the shared \texttt{successors} list with its ID (obtained with the \texttt{welcome} message of the initial handshake). If it matches, the client will publish a server as described in section~\ref{sub:approach_conceptual_description}. Otherwise, it will continue listening for service discovery events until a service with the app's name is available and connect to it.

\textbf{Simultaneous disconnection.} In this scenario, the server and one or multiple clients fail within a short time frame. For example, both the server and the first successor could disconnect and other clients would not receive the update that the first successor disconnected. If we did not target this case specifically, no client would become the new server because they all expect a disconnected client to do so. We solve this problem with a \textit{repeated timer} algorithm: clients that are not the first item in the \texttt{successor} list set a timer that will prune the first item from the list after some time. This interval is set sufficiently to give the current first successor enough time to publish the service. The interval is varied with a random number to make it highly unlikely that two clients prune successors at about the same time which could result in race conditions publishing a service. At some point in this process, one other client will be the first in the \texttt{successors} list and will become a server. Other clients will be notified eventually by a service discovery event and connect to the new server.
