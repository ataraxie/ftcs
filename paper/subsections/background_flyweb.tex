\subsection{FlyWeb}
\label{sub:background_flyweb}

The \textit{FlyWeb} project\footnote{http://flyweb.github.io/}, developed by the Mozilla Firefox community, aims to bring the convenience of Zeroconf functionality to the versatility and ubiquity of Web applications.
FlyWeb enables scripts in the browser to start local Web servers, and to have those servers be locally discoverable and addressable by providing a built-in implementation of mDNS and DNS-SD.
It also provides a browser extension to discover and easily connect to local FlyWeb services.
The goal is for devices on a local network to be able to stream applications and content to one another using widely available Web technology.\footnote{https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/09/flyweb-pure-web-cross-device-interaction/}
FlyWeb was released in mid-2016, but is no longer actively maintained as of August 2017.
