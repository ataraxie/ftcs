\subsection{Availability and fault tolerance}
\label{sub:background_replication}

In a fault-tolerant client-server system, the goal is for clients to experience minimal service disruption in the face of a server fault (most commonly, if the server crashes or becomes otherwise disconnected from the network).
A natural approach to achieving this behaviour is server redundancy, i.e. the use of backup servers: the higher the degree of redundancy (i.e. the more backup servers), the lower the likelihood of a catastrophic failure where all servers fail independently within a short timespan.
However, implementing fault-tolerance through redundancy is a challenging problem: the CAP theorem proves that no redundant system can simultaneously satisfy the properties of consistency, availability, and partition tolerance \cite{gilbert2002brewer}.
More generally, this describes the fundamental set of tradeoffs faced by any strategy for ensuring fault tolerance through redundancy.
Similarly, stronger consistency guarantees come at the cost of higher latency during normal operation: at one end of the spectrum, strong consistency requires all replicas to agree on every operation.

One strategy of replication, \textit{lazy replication}\footnote{also called \textit{optimistic replication}} \cite{Ladin:1990,Ladin:1992}, aims to provide the highest possible performance and availability by sacrificing consistency significantly.
With this approach, replicas periodically exchange information, tolerating out-of-sync periods; thus, state may diverge on replicas, but is guaranteed to converge when the system quiesces for some period of time.
This underlying consistency model is termed ``eventual consistency'', and has recently come to prominence in such high-profile applications as online editing platforms, NoSQL cloud databases, and big data processing frameworks \footnote{\url{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/consistency-explained-1659908.pdf}, accessed 2017-10-08}.
Eventual consistency is a weak consistency model, providing no guarantee for safety as long as replicas have not converged.
A stronger model of eventual consistency is offered by \textit{conflict-free replicated data types} (CRDTs) \cite{Shapiro:2011}: any two replicas that receive the same updates, no matter the order, will be in the same state.

Clearly, the choice of consistency model impacts the application designer, since the level and types of guarantees required vary depend a great deal on the specific application.
