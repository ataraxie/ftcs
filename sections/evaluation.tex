\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

Due to the nature of our project, i.e. an offline fault-tolerant client-server web browser API, our evaluation will be twofold. First, we want to measure network traffic in this offline network and then compare it against a traditional client-server web application. Despite having different network characteristics, this comparison will help us in identifying and discussing possible benefits and drawbacks of our approach. Second, we want to measure network traffic in face of failures. How much network traffic is required to achieve stability once a server device fails? How long does it take? Is our approach scalable? These are some of the questions that we want to answer with the second evaluation.

In order to measure network traffic, we will rely on a packet analyzer such as Wireshark\footnote{\url{https://www.wireshark.org/}}. As for our second evaluation, we will write scripts that simulate clients connecting to a server device through our \APIname{} API. Once a set of clients establish communication, our simulation will then remove the server device from the network such that we can evaluate how \APIname{} handles failures.
