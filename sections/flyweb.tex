\label{sec:flyweb}

FlyWeb\footnote{https://flyweb.github.io/spec/} is a web API developed by the Mozilla Firefox community\footnote{https://wiki.mozilla.org/FlyWeb} which enables web applications to connect and communicate to each other over a local-area network. 
To do so, FlyWeb relies on a zero-configuration network and its mDNS/DNS-SD protocols~\cite{rfc6762, rfc6763}. With FlyWeb, a web page may be seen as a device, which hosts a server. This device advertises itself to other client devices in the local network and, eventually, these other clients will discover and connect to the advertised server. Thus, connected clients/servers enable cross-device communication.
