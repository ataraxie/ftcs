\subsection{Flyweb}
\label{sec:flyweb}

FlyWeb is a Web API developed by the Mozilla Firefox community which enables clients of Web applications to publish a local server from within the browser. Building on the concept of zero-configuration networks and its mDNS/DNS-SD protocols~\cite{rfc6762, rfc6763}, the server advertises itself in the local network and can be discovered by other devices which become clients to the server by connecting via a HTTP or WebSocket connection. This essentially enables cross-device communication within a local-area network.
