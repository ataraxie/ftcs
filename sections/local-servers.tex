\subsection{Local-area frameworks}
\label{sec:flyweb}

FlyWeb is a Web API developed by the Mozilla Firefox community which enables clients of Web applications to publish a local server from within the browser. Building on the concept of zero-configuration networks and its mDNS/DNS-SD protocols~\cite{rfc6762, rfc6763}, the server advertises itself in the local network and can be discovered by other devices which become clients to the server by connecting via a HTTP or WebSocket connection. This essentially enables cross-device communication within a local-area network.

Google Nearby Connections\footnote{\url{https://developers.google.com/nearby/connections/overview}} is a peer-to-peer networking API that allows apps to discover, connect and exchange data to other devices in a local area network. The Nearby Connections app work through a combination of Bluetooth, BLE, and Wifi hotspots in order to exchange data. However, the API does not provide details about protocols and how devices are resolved.

Opera Unite\footnote{\url{http://www.operasoftware.com/press/releases/general/opera-unite-reinvents-the-web}} also has a technology that starts a local server in the Opera browser. Their technology allows file sharing, photo sharing, and other features but, similar to Google Nearby Connections, their documentation does not clearly specify which technologies are used.
